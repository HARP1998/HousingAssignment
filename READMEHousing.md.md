# Project Name
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. 

 

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

How well those variables describe the price of a house.

## General Information
- This project finds the best predictor values for housing increases. 
- The background of this project is a housing company trying to build a model. 
- The business problem that is being solved is what the best predictor variables are for house prices and whether to invest in them or not. 
- The dataset that is used is a set from the sale of houses in Australia.
